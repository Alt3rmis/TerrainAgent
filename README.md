# TerrainAgent
This is a terrain agent project
There are numerous disciplines in which procedural terrain generation has applicability. Computer games are the most often assigned sector. There has been prior study on software agents, although it primarily focuses on terrain generation for open-world games. This design is centred on producing corpus that can be applied to a bigger environment. Since software agents are employed to build the terrain, the user is able to adjust the agent's parameters to influence the resulting terrain.
